Emotion detection app deploy


keras model web app deployment using streamlit

some additions: charting with streamlit, spinner with streamlit, and ballons with streamlit

initial credits to Inspirit AI

If you wanna contribute some stuff, potential extensions, I'd love to see:

  - Currenly, the AI model is using transfer learning with pre-trained VGG-16 backend
  
  - More pre-trained models can be added: ResNet, MobileNet, etc.
  
  - More emotions support
  
  - support video feed with OpenCV probably
  
  if want real challenge, trying to use RNNs or LSTMs to track the facial features and output emotions in real-time (myself working on these too)
  
Internal note:

Potentially, add c++ support and made it deployable on MCU with camera.
